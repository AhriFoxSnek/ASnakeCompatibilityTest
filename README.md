# ASnakeCompatibilityTest
A test for ASnake's Python-Compatibility mode, to make sure regressions are not introduced.
Test codes are taken from rosettacode.org . All ASnake updates and versions should be able to fully pass this test. The script has capability to do some minor performance testing VS vanillia Python, but should mostly be used for compatibility checking after modifying the ASnake compiler.

rosettaCodes folder requires `numpy` as a dependency.


Requires ASnake, duh.
